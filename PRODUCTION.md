# FFU App Production Deployment Guide

## Security Features

### âœ… Implemented Security Measures

1. **Data Privacy**
   - All user first names anonymized to "Manager"
   - Only team names and last initials retained for identification
   - No personally identifiable information exposed

2. **Security Headers**
   - Helmet.js for security headers
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) configured
   - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP in production
   - 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP in development

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Configurable origin via environment variables
   - Credentials disabled
   - Only GET methods allowed

5. **Input Validation**
   - JSON payload size limited to 10MB
   - Request timeout configured
   - Express security best practices

## Environment Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables

Create `/backend/.env` for production:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=production

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Optional: Add logging level
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Frontend Environment Variables

Create `/frontend/.env` for production:

```env
# Production API URL
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install security packages
npm install helmet express-rate-limit

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy the dist/ folder to your static hosting service
```

### 3. Security Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured for production
- [ ] CORS origin set to your frontend domain
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] Security headers verified with security scanner
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Database connections secured (if applicable)
- [ ] API endpoints tested for security vulnerabilities

## Recommended Hosting Platforms

### Backend (API)
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with buildpacks
- **Railway**: Modern platform with good Node.js support
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Scalable container platform
- **AWS ECS/Lambda**: Enterprise-grade with auto-scaling

### Frontend (Static)
- **Vercel**: Optimized for React/Vite applications
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites with form handling
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Fast global CDN
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Cost-effective for high traffic

## Monitoring & Logs

Consider adding these for production:

1. **Application Monitoring**
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring (DataDog, New Relic)
   - Uptime monitoring (Pingdom)

2. **Logging**
   - Structured logging with Winston or Pino
   - Log aggregation (ELK stack, LogRocket)
   - Security event logging

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Backend**
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Implement response caching where appropriate
   - Database query optimization (if applicable)
   - Connection pooling for external APIs

2. **Frontend**
   - Code splitting already enabled with Vite
   - Asset optimization
   - Service worker for caching
   - Image optimization

## Security Maintenance

- Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
- Monitor security advisories
- Review and rotate any API keys/secrets
- Backup data regularly
- Test security headers periodically

## Emergency Procedures

1. **Security Incident Response**
   - Immediately revoke compromised credentials
   - Review access logs
   - Update affected users
   - Patch vulnerabilities

2. **Downtime Recovery**
   - Health check endpoints configured at `/health`
   - Database backup restoration procedures
   - CDN cache invalidation if needed
